# Java Basics Repository

This repository contains Java code examples for various basic programming concepts. Each code file is named according to its purpose and is provided with a brief description.

## Files

### arrayIndexSwap.java
This program demonstrates how to swap elements in an array by swapping their indices.

### exp1.java
A basic Java program that takes two integer inputs and prints "Hello World" in a grid of size specified by the inputs.

### exp2.java
A Java program that takes an integer `n` as input and an array of `n` integers. It then prints the index and value of each element in the array.

### exp3.java
An example of using the `StringBuilder` class to manipulate strings, including appending text and converting the `StringBuilder` to a `String`.

### exp4.java
This program takes a string as input and reverses it using a `StringBuilder`.

### exp5bit.java
A simple Java program that demonstrates the use of bitwise AND operation.

### InsertionSort.java
A Java program that implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. It provides two implementations of insertion sort with different counting methods.

### recExp1.java
A recursive Java program that prints numbers from N to 1.

### recExp2.java
A Java program that accepts an array of integers and calls a function to sort it. (Function implementation is incomplete.)

### recExp3.java
A recursive Java program to calculate the sum of numbers from N to 1.

### recExp4.java
A Java program that calculates the factorial of a given integer using a recursive function.

### recExp5.java
A Java program that generates the Fibonacci series using a recursive function.

### recExp6.java
A Java program that calculates the power of a number using recursion.

### recExp7.java
A Java program that calculates the power of a number using a recursive function with an optimized approach.

### SelectionSort.java
A Java program that implements the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. It counts the number of comparisons during sorting.

### LL.java
A Java class that defines a basic linked list and provides methods for adding, removing, and manipulating nodes in the list. It also contains an incomplete method to check if the list is a palindrome.

### sol1.java
A Java program that defines a ListNode class for singly-linked lists and contains an incomplete method to check if a linked list is a palindrome. 

## Usage
You can clone this repository and run the Java programs to understand and explore various basic programming concepts in Java.

Please note that some programs may be incomplete or require additional functionality. Feel free to contribute to this repository and make improvements. If you find any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
